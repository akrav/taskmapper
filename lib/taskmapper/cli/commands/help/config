This command is used to configure taskmapper settings for use in your terminal.

By default, taskmapper searches for the config information in a file named 'taskmapper.yml' in the current directory. Next it searches for 'config/taskmapper.yml' and if that fails, it uses the home directory's ~/.taskmapper.yml (note the . in front on this one). There is also the TASKMAPPER environment variable that you can set to point to another configuration file anywhere if necessary.

This command helps facilitate the creation of a taskmapper.yml.

Warning: Due to the way the authentication is parsed, if any keys or values contain a comma (,) or colin (:), it can not be parsed through the -A command. Usually this isn't a problem, and if it is, it can be resolved though putting the values in a config file.

Example:
  tm -c ~/.taskmapper.yml -p dummy -A username:cheese,password:cakes -P 555 config --add
  tm -p dummy config --set-default-provider

The format for taskmapper.yml is:
  default: <default provider>
  <provider name>:
    authentication:
      <authentication information>
    project: <project>
  [...]

For example, a taskmapper.yml with the Dummy provider would look something like this:
  default: dummy
  dummy:
    authentication:
      username: name
      password: doesnt-matter
    project: 555
