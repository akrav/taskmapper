This command is used to open an irb session with the taskmapper.

The configuration for this command should mostly be dependent on the taskmapper.yml files.
See taskmapper help config for more information on how to set it up.

Example:
  tm console
  tm -p dummy console
  tm -p dummy console -d --tracer

By default, it attempts to load all providers listed in the config unless a provider is explicitly given.

All options passed to console is passed to the irb session. See irb --help for those options and their details
