This command is used to open an irb session with the ticketmaster.

The configuration for this command should mostly be dependent on the ticketmaster.yml files.
See ticketmaster help config for more information on how to set it up.

Example:
  ticketmaster console
  ticketmaster -p dummy console
  ticketmaster -p dummy console -d --tracer

By default, it attempts to load all providers listed in the config unless a provider is explicitly given.

All options passed to console is passed to the irb session. See irb --help for those options and their details
