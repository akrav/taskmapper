This command is used to configure ticketmaster settings for use in your terminal.

By default, ticketmaster searches for the config information in a file named 'ticketmaster.yml' in the current directory. Next it searches for 'config/ticketmaster.yml' and if that fails, it uses the home directory's ~/.ticketmaster.yml (note the . in front on this one). There is also the TICKETMASTER_CONFIG environment variable that you can set to point to another configuration file anywhere if necessary.

This command helps facilitate the creation of a ticketmaster.yml.

Example:
  ticket -c ~/.ticketmaster.yml -p dummy -A username:cheese,password:cakes -P 555 config --add
  ticket -p dummy config --set-default-provider

The format for ticketmaster.yml is:
  default: <default provider>
  <provider name>:
    authentication:
      <authentication information>
    project: <project>
  [...]

For example, a ticketmaster.yml with the Dummy provider would look something like this:
  default: dummy
  dummy:
    authentication:
      username: name
      password: doesnt-matter
    project: 555
